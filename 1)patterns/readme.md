## 4 Rules for solving pattern based problems:

patterns -> nested loops

1. For outer loop, count the number of lines/rows
2. For inner loop, count the nuber of columns & connect them somehow to row
3. Whatever you're printing print them inside the inner for loop
4. Observe symmetry (optional step, not mandatory)
